Hiberntor was made because i didn't want to overuse the power  button on my laptop.

you may need to recreate the shortcut and change the icon as I don't know if it will work right off the  bat (haha, bat...)

I use Razer synapse to bind the program to Function+Delete on my laptop, but other keybinding programs such as Autohotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) may work just fine

this is one of my very first batch projects so excuse the bloat (it's not pretty)

The icon was created in GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/)

anyway, never had to make a README before so uhh... have a nice day!
